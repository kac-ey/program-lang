# program-lang

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I created a banking application to highlight the importance of fiscal responsibility and allow the user to see the impact of consistent saving over time.

# What did you do particularly well?
The format of the application was clean and user-friendly. Various user-errors were accounted for and provided specific and user friendly error messages. Nearly all necessary code was kept isolated in classes, maximizing the readability and security of the application.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
It took quite a lot of code to verify that user's input was integers. I would imagine there is a much more efficient way of verifying this information that is outside of the scope of what I have learned so far.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging piece of code by far was verifying that user input was valid and in acceptable format. Trying to account for all the various mistakes users might make when entering values was difficult. I also ran into some issues getting the output to line up properly in their columns, but overcame this issue fairly quickly through trial and error.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The use of formatting, encapsulation, and error prevention were prominent parts of this project that I foresee being valuable skills that I will take with me to other projects and course work.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Isolating almost all of the code in a separate class and using main solely for exception handling makes the source code incredibly easy to read. Given this project involved many processes that were repeated, breaking down each of these processes into individual functions helped reduce the amount of code as well. Furthermore, if I were to expand this application in the future, I would merely need to add functions for additional computations, or a class for more flexibility, and then only any necessary exception handling would be needed in main to make the application functional.
